# Threat Event (Suspicious PowerShell)
**Unauthorized PowerShell Script Execution and Download Attempt**

## Steps the "Bad Actor" took Create Logs and IoCs:
1. Open PowerShell Stealthily with Execution Policy Bypass
2. Download a malicious payload from the internet Using ```Invoke-WebRequest```: https://www.eicar.org/download/eicar-com/
3. Rename File Locally Using PowerShell:
   - **Purpose: Attempt to convert the downloaded payload to an executable in preparation for running it.**
4. Attempted Execution of Payload
   - **NOTE: Execution will fail because renaming the file does not make it a valid Windows executable (corrupted/unreadable).**
5. Delete the file
